remona, a symbolic remote monitor/debugger for 8-bit computers
By Matt Sarnoff (msarnoff.org)
==============================================================

remona is mainly meant to be a tool for easy assembly language development
on 8-bit computers. It will be able to communicate with a remote machine
over a serial cable, send it code, set breakpoints, read memory and register
values, etc.

It will initially target the Motorola 6809 processor (since I am currently
building my own 6809-based system) but it will be easily extensible.

I thought writing a remote debugger from scratch would be more fun than just
implementing the GDB remote protocol. :-P

More coming soon...
